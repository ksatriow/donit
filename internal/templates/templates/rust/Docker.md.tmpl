# Docker Setup for Rust Project

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose for containerization.

## Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10 or later
- Docker Compose 2.0 or later

## Quick Start

1. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:{{.Port}}`

## Commands

### Build the image
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Run the application
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Run in detached mode
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop the application
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Execute commands in container
```bash
docker-compose exec app sh
```

## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build configuration
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Service orchestration
- `.dockerignore` - Files excluded from Docker build context

## Health Check

The container includes a health check that monitors the application at `/health` endpoint.

## Notes

- The application runs as a non-root user for security
- Multi-stage build ensures minimal final image size
- Cargo dependencies are cached for faster builds
